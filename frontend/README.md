Starting with a Vite-Powered React App

Our journey began not with the traditional create-react-app, but with Vite, a modern build tool that focuses on providing a faster and more streamlined development experience. Opting for Vite over other tools was a decision driven by its promise of instant server start and lightning-fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR), among other benefits.

To kick off our React project, we used the following command:

sh
Copy code
npm create vite@latest my-app --template react
This command scaffolds a new React project pre-configured with Vite, allowing us to dive straight into development without worrying about complex configurations. The choice of Vite significantly improved our development workflow, thanks to its out-of-the-box optimizations and features.

This app is the frontend for a full-stack application that includes a Node.js backend and a Firestore database. The frontend is responsible for displaying the data fetched from the backend and providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the application.

The app  shows different artists and artwors featured in the Chicago Art Museum


## Features

- **List of Artists**: Displays a list of artists from the Chicago Art Museum.
